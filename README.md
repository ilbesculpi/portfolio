## Usage

This repository primarily serves as the source code for my deployed portfolio. However, if you're interested in running it locally for review or modification (with proper attribution, of course!), follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [git@github.com:ilbesculpi/portfolio.git)
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will typically run the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
